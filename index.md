I'm intrigued by data and the ways in which it shapes our lives. I love working with Time Based Media, especially digital art, and executed the 2016-2017 restoration of <a href="http://brandon.guggenheim.org/">BRANDON</a> a 1998-1999 piece of netart by Shu Lea Cheang. My personal projects tend to focus on the conservation/creation of net art, I'm an active skater with <a href="https://emmadickson.github.io/bcrd/">Bull City Roller Derby</a> and I'm employed as a Data Scientist/Developer with IBM.
